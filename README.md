# Handwritten Vietnamese Recognition
## Motivation
Not many people know that my name is not *Thu*, but it's actually *Thư*, and the ways these two words are pronounced are also different. Vietnamese written alphabet is a Latin-based script but it has various dialectical marks that make Vietnamese a very nuanced language. My motivation for pursuing this project is: 1) I love my mother tongue language because the nuances make it so special and beautiful, and 2) I believe in the meaningful applications of handwriting recognition in many settings, such as education, clinical settings, banking, etc.
